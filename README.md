# MinecraftOnlineOnDiscordChannel
Bot is checking how many players are on minecraft server, then put's this value on discrod's voice channel name.

Simply type ip, channel's id, bot token and run the bot.
Default (and suggested) refresh time is 60seconds. You can change it but below 20s is NOT recommended. Below 20 bot might reach rate limit which causes longer timeout.
